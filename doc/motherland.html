            <h5>Ghana</h5>
            <p> "This is our own native land;<br>
                What a priceless heritage,<br>
                Acquired with the blood our ancestors shed for us;<br>
                It is now our turn to continue what our ancestors started,<br>
                Know-it-all behavior, cheating and selfishness;<br>
                Has scarred our character and diminished our affection for our land."<br> <br><br> <br><br> <br></p>
            <h1><i class="fas fa-child"></i> &nbsp; Youth</h1>
            <p> During my 3 week visit to Ghana, I was fortunate to explore new terrain and dig a little deeper to broaden my knowledge and perspective on my country, Ghana. While doing, so I found a lot of pleasure in distant observation, where I noticed and experienced so much joy just by watching in silence.<br><br> I would love to share all my experiences with you, except that it will take me forever. Instead, let me focus on the young people I saw and how they made me feel.<br><br></p>
            <div class="imghold">
                    <img class="mid" src='../img/mum/kidoo.jpg'>
                    <img class="mid" src='../img/mum/kido.jpg'>
            </div>
            <p><br>In the midst of crippling poverty, corruption, huge income disparity, low standard of living, amongst others. I found that these kids were content and happy with the little that they had.<br><br> Not that they were oblivious to the pain and unfairness in any way, it was very clear that they knew, yet they seem to have chosen to ignore it.<br><br> The young girl in the pictures above, express both how I felt and the riveting and bustling energy of curiousity in youth. I found her at the port of Nzulezu where she  wanderered with her siblings bursting with energy and innocence.<br><br> I couldn't help but pull out my camera and stare at her through my lens, as she discovered new things in her environment.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <h1><i class="fas fa-surprise"></i> &nbsp; Akwidaa</h1>
            <p>I have been on many trips to villages and rural areas in Ghana with my dad, yet, it had never occured to me the severity of social disparity in Ghana.<br><br> This trip was to Akwidaa.<br><br> A small town and fishing village in Ahanta West district, a district in the Western Region of south-west Ghana, and one of the southernmost places in Ghana.<br><br></p>
            <div class="imghold">
                <img class="mid" src='../img/mum/2.jpg'>
                <img class="mid" src='../img/mum/4.jpg'>
            </div>
            <p><br>I stayed in a little hut on the beach with my sister. Where I woke up to the soothing sound of waves crashing at the shore and ticklish giggles of birds chirping in the air. Akwidaa has a very strong community because of its size.<br><br> My disposition enabled me to compare my everyday life to that of the people here. I was blown away at how well they did without access to many basic amenities. The people here worked hard effortlessly and it inspired me to aspire for more and appreciate all that I was born into.<br><br> Their way of life is what made me realize the gaping hole between life in Accra, the capital city and life here.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <h1><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i> &nbsp; Makola</h1>
            <p>Anyone who lives in Accra has heard of the Makola market. When I was much younger, (not that I am old) my mother used to leave me in the car when she visited the market.<br><br> It was frustrating because I was between the devil and the big blue sea. I didn't want to out of the car and smell the poignant fish or the toxic gutters, yet at the same time, I didn't want to be in the car, alone, drenched in sweat, without the air conditioning.<br><br> This is how she knew I was spoilt. She would often leave me in the car for close to an hour and return with a kayayo lady with heaps of groceries.<br><br></p>

                <img class="mid" src='../img/mum/mak.jpg'>
                <img class="mid" src='../img/mum/mak1.jpg'>
            </div>
            <p><br>My response to her return was a big frown with beads of sweat crawling down my forehead. I didn't care about the market at all but the nostalgia of home during my visit made me want to go there.<br><br> Now, I can boldy say, going to the market in Ghana is nothing like going to walmart or fresh grocers. The smell will forever pervade the market however, there's a lot more to focus on when you're in there. I wanted to be able to say I know what's up when I'm asked!<br><br> I'm not going to tell you until you ask. DM @phidelele or @fidelcustro on instagram ;)<br><br><br><br></p>
